## How it works?

### Login

You'll have to login to do anything. The available users are `sarahedo`, `johndoe` and `tylermcginnis`. Use whatever password you want as the only verification done to login is that the user exists.

### Home

All questions are listed here, classified as `non answered` and `answered`. There's a toggle control decide what category you want to see at a time.

### Add question

Post a new question to allow any user to answer it. A question simply consists of two options, and they should be related in some way as the idea is the users to have some trouble deciding what they choose. A user can answer a question just once, and of course cannot change his mind.

### Leaderboard

Displays the top users information, ranked according to the sum of questions posted and answered.
